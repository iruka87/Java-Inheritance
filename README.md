# Java-Inheritance
This repository comprisses of single, hierarchical, hybrid, multilevel and multiple inheritance.
A more detailed desciption of the programs:
    Single Inheritance: Dog inherits from Animal (one parent, one child).
    Multilevel Inheritance: Puppy inherits from Dog, which inherits from Animal (chain of inheritance).
    Hierarchical Inheritance: Dog and Cat both inherit from Animal (one parent, multiple children).
    Multiple Inheritance: Bird implements Flyable and Singable interfaces (multiple interfaces in Java, as direct multiple class inheritance isn't allowed).
    Hybrid Inheritance: Parrot inherits from Bird (which implements Flyable and extends Animal), combining multilevel and interface-based inheritance.

Each program includes a main method to demonstrate the inherited and specific behaviours of the classes.
